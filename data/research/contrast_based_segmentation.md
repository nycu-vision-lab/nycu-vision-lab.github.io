## Contrast-Based Color Image Segmentation

We propose a color image segmentation algorithm based on contrast information instead
of conventional derivative-based edge detection. In the CIE L*a*b* color space, color
difference is adopted as the measure of color contrast.

A subjective experiment shows a weak correlation between perceived color contrast and
the absolute levels of (L*, a*, b*), implying that a single-threshold scheme can be
used to suppress perceptually faint boundaries.

A complete segmentation scheme is developed, and simulation results demonstrate its
superiority in providing reasonable and reliable color image segmentation.
