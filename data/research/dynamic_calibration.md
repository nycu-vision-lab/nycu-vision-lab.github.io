## Dynamic Calibration of Multiple Cameras

We propose a new algorithm for dynamic calibration of multiple cameras. Based on the
mapping between a horizontal plane in 3D space and the 2D image plane of a panned and
tilted camera, the displacement of feature points and the epipolar-plane constraint
among multiple cameras are used to infer changes of pan and tilt angles for each
camera.

The algorithm does not require complicated feature correspondences and can be applied
to surveillance systems with wide-range coverage. It also allows the presence of moving
objects in the captured scenes while performing dynamic calibration.
