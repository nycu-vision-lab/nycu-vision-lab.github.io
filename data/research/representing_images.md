## Representing Images Using Points on Image Surfaces

This work presents a new approach to represent an image by “verge points,” defined as
high-curvature points on the image surface. This representation provides a compact and
reversible way to preserve the essence of the original image.

Various applications—including compression, edge detection, image enhancement, and
image editing—can be realized based on this verge-point representation. Image
reconstruction is achieved via iterative linear interpolation from extracted verge
points, which are further linked into verge curves for increased compactness.

Progressive representation is also developed based on a multiscale extraction scheme,
demonstrating the versatility of this representation.
