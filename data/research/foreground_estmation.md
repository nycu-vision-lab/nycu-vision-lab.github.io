## Unsupervised Matting and Foreground Estimation

This work presents a learning-based hierarchical graph framework for unsupervised
matting. The proposed hierarchical structure progressively condenses image data from
pixels into cells, from cells into components, and finally from components into
matting layers.

Unlike conventional approaches that typically address binary foreground/background
partitioning, our method provides a set of multi-layer interpretations for unsupervised
matting and foreground estimation.
