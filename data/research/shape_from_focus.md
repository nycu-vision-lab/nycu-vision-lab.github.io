## Shape-from-Focus Depth Reconstruction

Existing shape-from-focus (SFF) techniques, which reconstruct a dense 3D depth map
from multi-focus image frames, usually suffer from poor performance over low-contrast
regions and require a large number of frames to achieve satisfactory results.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a new depth reconstruction process that
estimates depth values by solving a MAP estimation problem with a spatial consistency
model. A cell-based version of the MAP framework is further proposed to improve
computational efficiency.

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve impressive
performance even with only a few image frames.
