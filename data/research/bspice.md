## Bayesian Structure-Preserving Image Contrast Enhancement (BSPICE)

An efficient Bayesian framework is proposed for image contrast enhancement. Based on
the image acquisition pipeline, the enhancement problem is modeled as a MAP estimation
problem, where the posterior probability is formulated using local information of the
given image.

To make the framework practical for typical enhancement tasks such as image editing,
the estimation process is converted into an intensity mapping process named Simplified
BSPICE, which achieves comparable enhancement performance with much lower computational
complexity.
