## Two Systolic Architectures for Modular Multiplication

This work presents two systolic architectures to accelerate modular multiplication in
RSA cryptosystems. In the double-layer architecture, the main operation of Montgomery’s
algorithm is partitioned into two parallel operations using precomputation of the
quotient bit.

In the non-interlaced architecture, the one-clock-cycle gap between iterations is
eliminated by pairing off the double-layer architecture. Comparisons with previous
Montgomery-based systolic architectures in both modular multiplication and modular
exponentiation indicate that the proposed architectures offer higher speed, lower
hardware complexity, and lower power consumption.
