## Two Systolic Architectures for Multiplication in GF(2<sup>m</sup>)

Two new systolic architectures are presented for multiplication in the finite field
GF(2<sup>m</sup>), based on the standard basis representation. In Architecture-I, a new
partitioning scheme for the basic cell is used in a straightforward systolic structure
to shorten the clock cycle period and speed up operation.

In Architecture-II, the one-clock-cycle gap between iterations is eliminated by
pairing off the cells of Architecture-I. Comparisons with previously proposed systolic
and semisystolic architectures show that Architecture-I offers the highest speed, while
Architecture-II achieves the lowest hardware complexity.
