## An Efficient Approach for the Calibration of Multiple PTZ Cameras

An efficient approach is proposed to infer the relative positioning and orientation
among multiple pan–tilt–zoom (PTZ) cameras. Tilt angle and altitude of each PTZ camera
are first estimated based on observations of simple objects lying on a horizontal
plane.

With the estimated tilt angles and altitudes, calibration of multiple cameras can be
performed by comparing the back-projected world coordinates of common vectors in 3D
space. The method does not require particular system setups or specific calibration
patterns.
