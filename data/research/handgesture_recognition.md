## Single-camera Hand Gesture Recognition for Human-computer Interface

We propose a hand gesture recognition technique for a remote-control human–computer
interface (HCI) using a single visible-light camera. The system is composed of an image
projector and a camera installed on the side of the panel.

A simple calibration process is first used to obtain the initial hand position and the
mapping between image coordinates and the projected board coordinates. A tracking
algorithm, assisted by a hand detection algorithm, is then developed to locate the hand
in cluttered backgrounds in real time. A gesture recognition module further interprets
the current gesture.

By projecting the detected hand position onto the screen, mouse functions can be
replaced and hand gestures can be used to control the system.
