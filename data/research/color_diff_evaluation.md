## Visible Color Difference Based Quantitative Evaluation of Color Segmentation

This work presents the use of visible color difference in a new quantitative evaluation
scheme for color segmentation. Two objective visual quantities—the quantity of missing
boundaries and the quantity of fake boundaries—are considered to avoid directly
evaluating subjective quality.

Visual rating experiments are conducted to analyze how missing and fake boundaries
affect perceived segmentation quality. To better fit human color perception, a visible
color difference measure is defined.

Based on these experiments and the visible color difference, two measures—named
intra-region visual error and inter-region visual error—are designed to estimate the
degrees of missing and fake boundaries, respectively, leading to a complete evaluation
scheme for color image segmentation.
